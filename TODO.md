- Improve parsing errors
- Add more combinators
- Do benchmarks with parsec, other parsing libraries
- Use TH to make typesafe parsers

### Eventually:
- Add staging with TH
- Improve error reporting

Multiple "backends": custom parser combinator, convert into parsec, use TH to generate more efficient code/erase types
